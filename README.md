Practice projects, some finished some unfinished or in need of refining

The only finished project is TICTACTOE game. 
First I programmed the JavaScript adding HTML divs as needed and bare bones of the game. 
Then I designed the interface in Figma and then used that as a quide for the layout I made in HTML and CSS.

If I wanted to I could maybe continue on this one and make a robot that plays against the user but at the moment I'm not interested in doing that, but might add it in in the future.
